# Enviro-Track-Shield
**Technologies:** Arduino UNO, Bluetooth, LCD, Temperature (DHT11), Humidity, Rain Detection, Flame Sensors

### Description
A portable environmental monitoring system that collects real-time data from multiple sensors and provides alerts via Bluetooth or mobile interface.

### Features
- Monitors **Temperature (DHT11)**, **Humidity**, **Rain**, and **Flame detection** in real-time.
- Displays live sensor data on an **LCD screen**.
- Sends **SMS/alerts** for critical environmental conditions.
- Fully integrated **working prototype** tested under various scenarios.

### Getting Started
1. Connect the sensors (DHT11, Rain, Flame) to the Arduino UNO according to the schematic.
2. Upload the Arduino sketch to the board.
3. Pair the device with a mobile phone via **Bluetooth (HC-05 module)**.
4. Observe real-time data on LCD and receive alerts for critical conditions.
